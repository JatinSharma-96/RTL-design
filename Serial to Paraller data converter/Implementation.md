Bit stream input coming synchronously with the clock. Sync goes low that's when the 8-bit packet starts, counter counts till 8 and then outputs the parallel data, then again the transmission of new packet starts.  
The input coming is 8-bit data packet. 32 different sources are sending the data serially, 8-bit packet from master 0, 8-bit packet packet from master 1 and so on till 8-bit packet of master 255. Assuming requirement of transmission as 10000 samples per second of each master, BW = 10000x32x8 bps = 2560 Kbps. So the frequency required is 2560 KHz. If the bus was 2 bits wide then required frequency would have been 2560/2 = 1280KHz.
